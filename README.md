# UAV-Impact-Scripts
Scripts for 3rd Year Individual Project

These scripts were created for my Dynamics of UAV Impacts 3rd year Individual Project. These include scripts for controlling a basic UAV, and acquiring data from rag-dolls.

To use these effectively, attach the UAV controller scripts to the UAV model and attach the data acquisition scripts to each rag-doll section.
